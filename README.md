<b>Ohyaou!</b> is a basic customisable homepage written for Firefox only. You're free (and encouraged) to download, edit and upload the code for use with other browsers. The HTML file features comments with detailing on what certain parts of the code do. I encourage you to have a go at modifying the code and to use this as practice in writting HTML and CSS. A good exercise would be to modify the CSS to make a dark version of the website.
