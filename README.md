Ohyaou is a basic customisable homepage written for Firefox only. You're free to (and encouraged) to download, edit and upload the code for use with other browsers. The HTML file features comments with detailing on what certain parts of the code do. I encourage you to have a go at modifying the code and to use this as practice in writting HTML and CSS.

Yes my CSS file is bad.

No I don't plan on fixing it. It works for me and that's all I need it for.
